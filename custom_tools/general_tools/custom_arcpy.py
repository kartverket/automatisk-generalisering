        - The selected features are stored permanently in a new feature class specified by `output_name`.
        - Cleans up by deleting the temporary feature layer to maintain a tidy workspace.

        input_layer (str): The path or name of the input feature layer.
        overlap_type (str or OverlapType): The type of spatial relationship to use for feature selection.
