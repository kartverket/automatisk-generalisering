# Automatisk Generalisering

This repository contains the scripts and tools for automatic cartographic generalization of geodata across multiple map scales.

## Documentation

The project documentation is organized into these main sections:

- **[Setup Guide](docs/setup/index.md)**  
  How to install dependencies, configure ArcPy, prepare your environment, and verify your setup.

- **[Contribution Guide](docs/contributing/index.md)**  
  Formatting standards, docstring guidelines, naming conventions, and collaboration workflow.

- **[Developer Reference](docs/developer_reference/index.md)**  
  Project structure, design conventions, IO system, runtime entrypoints, and internal architecture notes.

### Codebase documentation
- Our docstring documentation generated from Sphinx can be viewed here _(it needs more work to make it more traversable, reading the code and docstring documentation in an IDE is recommended for now)_: [(link)](https://kartverket.github.io/automatisk-generalisering/index.html)
