# The .gitignore file is a configuration file used in our project to specify which files or directories should be excluded from version control.
# It helps keep our repository clean and prevents Git from tracking files that are not meant to be shared among all team members.

# How It Works:
# - Any file or directory listed in the .gitignore file will be ignored by Git.
# - This means that changes made to these files will not be tracked, committed, or pushed to the repository.
# - It allows us to exclude files that are specific to individual users or generated during script execution.
# - The config.py file, for example, is listed in the .gitignore to ensure that user-specific paths and settings are not shared with others.

# Why It's Important:
# - Keeps our repository focused on code and shared resources.
# - Prevents conflicts and confusion when different team members have their own local configuration files.
# - Ensures that the main codebase remains clean and consistent.

# Usage:
# - If you have any files that are specific to your local env_setup or user preferences, you can add them to the .gitignore file.
# - These files will remain on your local machine but won't affect the shared codebase on GitHub.
# - Refer to the .gitignore file for a list of ignored files and directories.

# By using the .gitignore file, we can maintain a more organized and efficient version control system for our Python scripts and code.
# If you have any questions or need assistance with Git or version control, feel free to reach out to the team.

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
