    Summary:
        Needs summary

    Details:
        1. `setup_arcpy_environment`:
            Sets up the ArcPy environment based on predefined settings defined in `general_setup`.
            This function ensures that the ArcPy environment is properly configured for the specific project by utilizing
            the `general_setup` function from the `environment_setup` module.

        2. `selection`:
            Makes the selection of the relevant input features using a sub selection since the operation is too processing heavy to be done for the global dataset. Small scale test logic untill this logic is made OOP.

        3. `creating_raod_buffer`:
            This function creates a buffered feature with a size corresponding to the road width in its symbology.
            Then it iterates through the road features first creating a smaller buffer and gradually increasing the size.
            For each iteration uses the erase tool to erase the polgon created from building points to gradually move it away from road features to prevent overlapp with road features.

        4. `copy_output_feature`:
            Copies the last output of the `creating_raod_buffer` iteration to be able to integrate it into our `file_manager` system.
