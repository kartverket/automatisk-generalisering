    What:

        A cluster is defined as two or more points that are closer together than 200 meters.

    How:
        Clusters are found for both hospitals and churches using the 'FindPointClusters' tool.
        The CLUSTER_IDs are joined with the original hospital and church feature classes.
        Points belonging to a hospital or church cluster are selected as new layers.
        Points not belonging to a cluster are selected as new layers.
        The tool FindPointClusters has a search distance of **'200 Meters'** and a minimum of **'2 Points'**.

    Why?
        Clusters amongst hospital and churches are found because it causes "noise" in the map.
        We do not want the map to display clusters of big symbols, this can make the map harder to read.
        Therefore, we want to identify clusters and reduce these.

def reducing_clusters():
    """
    What:
        Reduces hospital and church clusters by keeping only one point for each detected cluster. This ensures that
        spatial redundancy is minimized, and each cluster is represented by a single point, which is helpful for
        cleaner visualizations in the map.
    Why:
        Clusters of hospitals or churches may result in overlapping or redundant data points, especially in dense
        areas. Reducing clusters by retaining only the most central point ensures the dataset remains representative
        without unnecessary duplication.

    How:
        The function creates a minimum bounding polygon for each cluster of points, which is then converted into a
        center point. The nearest hospital or church point to the center point is identified and retained, while
        the remaining points in the cluster are discarded. Hospital and church points that are not part of a cluster
        are merged with the retained cluster points. The 'RECTANGLE_BY_AREA' option is used to create the minimum
        bounding geometry for each cluster. The nearest point to the center of the bounding polygon is identified
        using a 'Near' analysis, and a dictionary is used to store the minimum distance values for each cluster.
        If two points have the same distance to the center, one is selected randomly. Finally, the non-clustered
        points are merged with the selected points from clusters, resulting in a merged feature class with reduced
        hospital and church points.
