    Summary:
        This script first propagates displacement for building polygons to ensure their alignment with roads
        at a scale of 1:100,000. Next, it resolves conflicts among all building polygons in Norway,
        considering various barriers such as roads, waterfeatures, hospital and churches, ensuring proper placement and scaling.

        Following conflict resolution, the script transforms building polygons marked as invisible into points.
        It also identifies visible building polygons that intersect roads and transforms them into points.
        Building polygons that do not intersect roads remain unchanged.

        The final output consists of two layers: a building polygon layer and a building point layer.

    Details:

        1. `propagate_displacement_building_polygons`:
            Copies building polygons and propagates displacement based on nearby generalized road features, moving the buildings.

        2. `features_500_m_from_building_polygons`:
            Identifies and selects water features and roads within a 500-meter radius of building polygons, making sure only necessary data is processed.

        3. `apply_symbology_to_layers`:
            Applies N100 symbology to building polygons, roads, and water features

        4. `resolve_building_conflict_building_polygon`:
            Resolves conflicts among building polygons, using roads, water features, hospital and churches as barriers

        5. `creating_road_buffer`:
            Generates buffer zones around various road types based on the thickness of their symbology

        6. `invisible_building_polygons_to_point`:
            Converts invisible building polygons into points

        7. `intersecting_building_polygons_to_point`:
            Identifies intersecting building polygons and converts them into points.
            Building polygons that are not made invisible by the previous function,
            nor intersecting roads will be kept as they are.

        8. `merging_invisible_intersecting_points`:
            Combines points derived from invisible and intersecting building polygons.

        9. `small_building_polygons_to_points`:
