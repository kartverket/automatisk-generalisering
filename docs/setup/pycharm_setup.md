## Setting up ArcPy python interpreter

Make sure you have ArcGIS Pro installed locally.

1. Locate the ArcGIS Pro install’s Python environment. By default:
```text
C:\ArcGIS_Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe
```

3. In PyCharm: File → Settings → Python Interpreter → gear icon → Add… → Existing → browse to the python.exe above → OK → set it as the project interpreter.

## Ensuring PyCharm Recognizes the Project Root
This step is only needed if PyCharm does not correctly resolve relative imports. 

1. Right click on the project directory → `Mark Directory as` → `Sources Root`
