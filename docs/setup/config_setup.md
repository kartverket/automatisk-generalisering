### 1. Create the config file
The current setup with config file needs rework and is planned to be improved in the future. If there are issues please contact someone on the team to help you set it up correctly.

- Create a file named `config.py` located in the root directory of your project. 
- Copy the contents of the file `template_config.py` into your newly created `config.py` file.
- Update the paths inside your `config.py` file to match your local environment.
